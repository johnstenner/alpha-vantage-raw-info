# alpha-vantage-raw-info
i just need to toss some info in here to access later in case i forget or accidentally delete it

# Looks like Alpha Vantage does not have the info on holdings if the company held in the fund is not listed on an american exchange. This also excludes OTC listed stocks. This is a big limitation for this tool.
# this is leading to incorrect weights for sectors.
# Also, it doesnt pull Real Estate sector data for any of the tested funds, IVV/ICLN/SPLG/MGC/VOO. Looking at the raw output in the terminal, Real Estate just isnt included in the retrieved sector data.
